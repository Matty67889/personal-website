			Welcome to The Crossing! In this game, you will control 3 humans and 3 blomfargles, and a hover car. The 6 people are on another planet,
			trying to make their escape from a wasteland. They have a hover car that they are riding in, but they have found themselves trapped on one
			side of a precipice! They have agreed to work together to overcome this obstacle. Unfortunately for the humans, their Blomfargle companions
			are deadly, and will eat the humans if they ever outnumber them on either side of the precipice. Can you get the party across the precipice
			without letting any humans die?

			<span class = "underline embolden title">Rules:</span></span>
			<ul>
				<li>There must be at least 1 person in the <span class = "embolden">Hover Car</span> for it to move to the other side of the precipice.</li>
				<li>There can only be 2 characters in the <span class = "embolden">Hover Car</span> at any time.</li>
				<li>If a character is inside the <span class = "embolden">Hover Car</span>, that character count as being on the side of the precipice that the <span class = "embolden">Hover Car</span> is on.</li>
				<li>If the number of <span class = "embolden">Blomfargles</span> outnumbers the number of <span class = "embolden">Humans</span> at any time, you lose the game.</li>
				<li>If you get all the <span class = "embolden">Blomfargles</span> and <span class = "embolden">Humans</span> to the other side of the precipice, you win the game.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<br />
			<br />
			
			<span class = "underline embolden title">Game Functions:</span></span>
			<ul>
				<li>
					When you start the game, there will be 6 characters on the screen: 3 <span class = "embolden">Humans</span> and 3 <span class = "embolden">Blomfargles</span>
					on the left side of the precipice, and a <span class = "embolden">Hover Car</span> in the middle of the precipice. There will also be an 
					action log at the side of the screen. Under the action log, there is a table that displays the location of each character. At the bottom of
					the screen, there will also be a button to reset the game, a button to return to the homescreen, and a button to reference the How to Play
					Page (will open in a new tab).
				</li>
				
				<br />
				
				<li>
					When you click on a character: 
					<ul>
						<li>If it is not in the <span class = "embolden">Hover Car</span>, it will move to the <span class = "embolden">Hover Car</span>.</li>
						<li>If it is in the <span class = "embolden">Hover Car</span>, it will move out of the <span class = "embolden">Hover Car</span>.</li>
						<li>It's position will update on the Side Tracker.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				
				<br />
				
				<li>
					Clicking on the <span class = "embolden">Hover Car</span> will make it move to the other side of the precipice. There must be at least 1 
					character in the car to make the <span class = "embolden">Hover Car</span> move. If there is not, the <span class = "embolden">Hover Car</span>
					will not move to the other side of the precipice, and a message will come up in the action log indicating that there is no driver for the
					<span class = "embolden">Hover Car</span> to move.
				</li>
				
				<br />
				
				<li>
					If you try to add another character to the <span class = "embolden">Hover Car</span> and there are already 2 characters in the
					<span class = "embolden">Hover Car</span>, the character that you tried to add to the <span class = "embolden">Hover Car</span> will remain
					where it is, and you will get a message in the action log telling you that you could not add the character to the
					<span class = "embolden">Hover Car</span> because it is full with 2 chracters.
				</li>
				
				<br />
				
				<li>
					If the <span class = "embolden">Blomfargles</span> ever outnumber the <span class = "embolden">Humans</span> on either side of the
					precipice, you will lose the game immediately. A message will display in the action log notifying you that you lost the game. You
					will not be allowed to interact with any of the items on the screen, unless you reset the game.
				</li>
				
				<br />
				
				<li>
					If you manage to get all characters on the other side of the precipice, you will win the game. The game will end as soon as the characters
					make it to the other side, even if the chracters are still inside the <span class = "embolden">Hover Car</span>. 
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<br />
			<br />
			
			Good luck!

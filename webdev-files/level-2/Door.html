				You give the deal a powerful blow to the crack, and it immediately crumbles before your might. To your surprise, you aren't immediately
				greeted by the dark light and bitter cold of the night. The crumbling of the crack revealed a small passageway, issuing a bright light 
				at its end.
				<br />
				<br />
				
				You decide to crawl down the path to see where it will lead you. After about a minute of crawling, you are met with a small arched door
				that you are sure you can fit through. You try to open it, but it seems to be locked.
				<br />
				<br />
				
				<span id = "thoughts">"Damnit, now I need a key?" you think angrily. It feels like I'm so close but these silly obstacles keep getting
				in my way.</span>
				<br />
				<br />
				
				What will you do now?

				make it through the door and see what awaits you!</p>

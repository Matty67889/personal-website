			<p>
				You walk into a poorly lit room. The room is cluttered with old items whose dust particles invade your lungs.
				You walk around the room, searching for anything useful to help you escape this house, but find nothing. After
				moving a giant wardrobe, a light fills your eyes. A window! You open the window and look out, and as you do so 
				the smile on your face disappears. The jump is too high to escape. You scour the outside land, hoping to find 
				some sign of civilization, but you find no one.
				<br />
				<br />
				
				"I'm sick of this!" you exclaim.
				<br />
				<br />
			
				You become discouraged, and dark thoughts start to fill your mind. Surely 
				<a href = "Game_Over.html"><span id = "interactable">jumping out the window</span></a> 
				can't be any worse than being trapped in this horrible house...

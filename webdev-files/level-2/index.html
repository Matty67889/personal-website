		<h3>
			<p>
				It's Halloween, and you and your 3 friends decided to visit a haunted house. You had heard about it yesterday and thought
				it would be a cool idea to test your friends' mettle and see if they would come with you. Surprisingly, they all agreed.
				<br />
				<br />
			
				Your party sets out at 10 pm to get to the house, enjoying humorous and tantalizing banter along the way. 
				<br />
				<br />
			
				"Ha, you're not even gonna step foot in there I bet!" one of your friends mused.
				<br />
				<br />
			
				"Yea," another agreed, "We're gonna get there and you're gonna wuss out."
				<br />
				<br />
			
				You ignored their comments and continued walking. <span id = "thoughts">"I'll show them,"</span> you thought to yourself.
				<br />
				<br />
			
				In about 7 minutes, you and your friends face the entrance of the haunted house. The place seems like a graveyard.
				Tombstones litter the front yard. Leafless trees thick with naked branches surround the house, like a cult making an offering
				to a higher being. Dead bushes are on both sides of the entrance.
				<br />
				<br />
			
				The house itself is tall and menacing, yet worn and tattered. Most of its adornments seemed to have stayed intact despite its old age.
				It's dull gray and blue color scheme dissuades visitors from entering, but the entrance staircase invites them. The color of the sky
				around it warns trespassers to turn back or suffer unimaginably horifying nightmares.  
				<br />
				<br />
			
				In one of the top windows, you notice a light is on, but you neglect to say anything to your friends, because you are afraid they 
				will think you are scared.
				<br	/>
				<br />
			
				"Sooo, who's first?" one of your friends says. 
				<br />
				<br />
				
				Showing no fear, you make your way up the entrance stairs and open the door to enter the house. Your friends stay back in the yard,
				watching you in awe. <span id = "thoughts">They're a just a bunch of hypocritical scaredy cats," you think." Haunted houses aren't
				even scary."</span>
				
				After you've made your way to the door of the house, you turn back to see where they are. They are standing in the yard, 
				huddling with each other like scared people in a horror movie. You open your mouth to call them out for their cowardice, when all
				all of a sudden, something hits your head very forecefully, knocking you out. Your friends watch in horror as something drags you 
				into the house, and the door slams shut. 
				<br />
				<br />
			
				Upon regaining consciousness, you stand up and survey your surroundings. <span id = "thoughts">"Where... where am I?"</span> you 
				think to yourself.
				
				<br />
				<br />
				You have to make it out of the haunted house and get back to your friends! Are you ready? Click Start to begin! (If you return to 
				the homepage, the game will restart.)
				<br />				
				
				(Also, you can click on the text in blue in the story to interact with it!)

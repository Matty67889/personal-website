			<p>
				You find yourself in a room that is surprisingly devoid of furniture. The only things you see in the room are a water fountain 
				looking object in the middle, a closet in a corner, and a radiator.
				<br />
				<br />
				
				The walls are cracked and stained with a brown material of some kind, supposedly dirt that has stuck to the wall after a very 
				long time. Rubble is scattered all about the floor, as if there was some kind of earthquake that knocked everything out of place.
				You cannot even properly determine what this place is supposed to be. Should you call it a 
				<span id = "interactable"><span id = "family_room" onclick = "changeToFamilyRoom();">Family Room</span></span>, 
				a <span id = "interactable"><span id = "foyer" onclick = "changeToFoyer();">Foyer</span></span>, a 
				<span id = "interactable"><span id = "home_office" onclick = "changeToHomeOffice();">Home Office</span></span>, or just leave it as 
				<span id = "interactable"><span id = "tri_q_mark" onclick = "changeToTriQMark();">???</span></span>?
				<br />
				<span id = "interactable">(Click the names to change the title at the top!)</span>
				
				<br />
				<br />
				
				You walk around the room looking for any clues, but find nothing.
				<br />
				<br />
				
				<span id = "thoughts">"There is probably nothing of value in this room, unless there is something in that closet,"</span> you think.
				<span id = "thoughts">"I'm not sure if I should check in there though. Seems creepy."</span>
				<br />
				<br />
				
				You start to make your way out of the room, but turn back, wondering if that <span id = "interactable" onclick = "readNote1();">closet</span>
				will yield anything.
				
				<!-- <div id = "counter_R4"></div> -->
				
				<p id = "r4_added_text">
				You find a note in the closet. It reads, 
				<br /> 
				
				<img src = "images/Notes/note1.PNG" /> 
				<br />
				
				You place the note back where it was, thinking about it's words. You wonder if you should take it seriously.

		<h3>
			<p>
				The room is surprisingly well made and well lit. Every piece of furniure is precisely placed, as if the owner of the house
				was expecting visitors. Chairs are neatly lined up on a large mat facing each other. There is a small brown table nect to
				one of the chairs with some items that you do not dare touch. An unlit fireplace with a small painting above it sits on one 
				side of the room.
				<br />
				<br />
			
				You notice that the room is covered in purple, and surmise that someone of royalty once lived in this house. 
				<br />
				<br />
			
				<span id = "thoughts">"This is probably the livingroom," you think to yourself.</span>
				<br />
				<br />
			
				Many questions emerge in your mind, but you have no time to think about them. You need to escape!
				<br />
				<br />
			
				You decide that the best course of action is to explore the house and see if you can find an exit anywhere. But which way
				to go...?

			<p>
				This room is surprisingly well kept, which is surprising to you considering the state of the other rooms. The room is complete
				with a bed, a small desk, a lamp, and a window that provides a nice view of the outside. The room has its contents neatly arranged
				and the bed is well made. Hanging on the wall above the bed are 3 pictures of a girl's face. The only difference between the
				pictures is their color. 
				<br />
				<br />
				
				<span id = "thoughts">"Why would the person that vandalized this house destroy everything except this room?" you wonder. Perhaps
				this room has some special signifcance to it?"</span>
				<br />
				<br />
				
				You scan the room for anything useful, but there is nothing in sight. You consider 
				<span id = "interactable" onclick = "readNote2();">checking the drawer</span>
				...no, theres probably some ghost demon baby in there. You decide that exploring rooms is your best bet.

				You find a note in the closet. It reads, 
				<br />
				
				<img src = "images/Notes/note2.PNG" />
				<br />
				
				You place the note back where it was, considering what to do next. What is this about a crack in the wall in the kitchen...?

				<span onclick = "display();">You</span> find youself in a room cluttered in papers. Along the walls of the rooms are several bookshelves containing hundreds
				of books. It looks like a lot of the books are stolen, because there are a lot of sections of the bookshelves with
				gaps filled with slanted books. You surmise that the room is either a really cluttered office or a library,
				the latter probably being more likely.
				<br />
				<br />
				
				You look up and realize that the ceiling is almost completely gone, revealing the wooden planks used to make its
				infrastructure. It seems as if the ceiling had collapsed on the ground, leaving some remnants of its components on the floor
				meshed with the scattered papers.
				<br />
				<br />
				
				You walk around the room carefully, rustling the worn and tattered papers at your feet as you go. A green sofa invites
				you to sit, but you think better of it. You look for clues as to how you are supposed to get out of here, but find nothing
				of interest. 
				<br />
				<br />
				
				Just as you lost hope, a lectern with a healthy looking book catches your eye. 
				<span id = "thoughts">"Why would that book be in such good shape if the rest of the room is such a mess?"</span> you ask 
				yourself. 
				<br />
				<br />
				
				As intrigued as you are, you are cautious
				about inspecting it because it radiates a mysterious aura. 
				<br />
				<br />
				
				You stand in front of the lectern, carefully pondering if you should continue to explore other rooms or 
				<span id = "interactable" onclick = "ownKey();">check the book.</span>
				
				<!--
				<div id = "key_tracker"></div>
				<div id = "counter_R3"></div>
				-->
				
				<p id = "r3_added_text">
				You open the book on the lectern, and a cloud of dust greets your face. It is a very old book, 
				filled with tiny words in a language you cannot read. You flip through the pages frantically, hoping to find something that 
				will help you. Sure enough, on page 432 of the book, you find a small key. 
				<br /> 
				
				<img src = "images/key.png" /> 
				<br /> 
				
				You pocket the key excitedly and continue in your search for an exit.

			<p>
				You enter a room with a lot of color, which surprises you. It seems to be a children's room, as you see many poorly drawn
				paintings of relatively uninteresting things. You are surprised they are still in-tact. 
				<br />
				<br />
				
				Many colorful children's products are also still in good shape in the room, such as a toy rocking pony, a stroller, and a
				small yellow chair. You are shocked that these items have withstood the wrath of whatever happened to this house. A lot of 
				things about this room surprise you. 
				<br />
				<br />
				
				<span id = "thoughts">"This room feels childish, but in a creepy way," you think to yourself. "It's like I'm in a horror
				movie where the protagonist is in a seemingly innocent room, and then they suddenly get jumped by a malicious apparition."
				</span>
				<br />
				<br />
				
				Realizing what you just thought, you turn around suddenly, expecting to be attacked. However, you see nothing behind you.
				No life-threatening ghost that wants to take your soul for invading its house. How unexciting. 
				<br />
				<br />
				
				You decide that there is nothing good to be gained from this room, and resolve to leave as soon as possible.
				
				However, as soon as you turn around to leave, an unusual looking object catches your eye, and you wonder if you should
				<span id = "interactable" onclick = "ownMallet();">give it a closer look...</span>
				
				<!-- <div id = "mallet_tracker"></div> -->
				
				<p id = "r9_added_text">You notice that there is a mallet in the playroom. <br /> <img src = "images/mallet.PNG" />
				<br />
				
				Despite your confusion as to why there would be a mallet in a children's playhouse, you decide to carry it with you, in case
				it becomes useful for bashing in some skulls. Nothing wrong with having a weapon in a haunted house.

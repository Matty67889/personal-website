				You enter the room, and immediately jump. The room is a bathroom, but there is blood in the sink!

				Though your stomach starts to feel a little queasy from the blood (you have hemophobia) but you decide that
				you don't need to use the bathroom, so you leave the room.

				<span id = "thoughts">"No thanks, not getting killed today!"</span> you exclaim upon leaving.

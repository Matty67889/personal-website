			<p id = "r1_default">
				You come across a room an extremely dusty room with 6 chairs surrounding a table. From this alone, you detemine that this
				room used to be a dining room. It reminds you of Alice in Wonderland, specifically the scene where Alice had the tea party
				with the Mad Hatter and the other creatures of her imagination. Except now the scene wasn't as colorful; there were no guests,
				no tea, no food, and rubble covering the table.
				<br />
				<br />
				
				On the side of the table appeared to be a small cupboard, with a single in-tact jar sitting solemnly on its counter. Some drawers
				of the cupboard were opened, and their contents taken, as if a very hungry someone had been rumaging through it looking for a 
				snack.
				<br />
				<br />
				
				Across the room from the cupboard, on the other side of the table, there is another, larger cupboard, who has a much larger
				storage capability. It has also been deprived of its contents and also has a single storage vessel on its counter, a teapot.
				<br />
				<br />
				
				<span id = "thoughts">"This person really likes their teapots I guess,"</span> you muse.
				<br />
				<br />
				
				On one side of the room, you notice a window with bright light emitting through it. You find it odd, because you and your friends
				arrived at the haunted house at an extremely late time, so it sould not be sunny outside. You conclude that either time is warped
				in this house, or your eyes are playing tricks on you. 
				<br />
				<br />
				
				You consider if you should <span id = "interactable" onclick = "windowChecked();">inspect the window</span> to find out what's going on, 
				or if you should just keep exploring rooms.
				
				<!-- <div id = "counter_R1"></div> -->
				
				<p id = "r1_added_text">
				You walk up to the window and try to look up out of it, but see nothing but the bright light striking your face. You try opening the 
				window, but it does not budge. You look closer at the window, and realize that the light coming from it is only a painting that is 
				somehow emitting light. Mysterious forces are at work in this house.

				You open the door and find yourself in a short hallway. There is a lone chair sitting in the middle, facing towards a window. 
				<br />
				<br />
				
				<span id = "thoughts">"Maybe there's a ghost person sitting in the chair, looking out the window, just pondering over 
				past transgressions and regrets."</span> you wonder. <span id = "thoughts">Maybe I was thrown into this house to learn a 
				lesson about not doing silly things like exploring haunted houses because I might regret it in the future.</span>
				<br />
				<br />
				
				<span id = "thoughts">Nah, that's silly. I'm probably going crazy from being in this house too long. I needa get outta here.</span>
				<br />
				<br />
				
				Suddenly, in your head, you think you hear a faint crying noise, but you immediately shake your head to dispel it. No ghosts
				in here.

		<h3>
			<p>
				You walk into a very old looking brown room that appears to be a bedroom. The room has an unkempt bed, 2 desks, and a mirror.
				The mirror has a giant crack running through it, as if someone punched it out of frustration. Some of the drawers of the 
				desks are left ajar.
				<br />
				<br />
				
				You look up at the ceiling and notice is it not breaking like most of the others. For a bedroom, this room does not have 
				much to it.
				<br />
				<br />
				
				<span id = "thoughts">"Not much to this room, huh," you remark in your head.</span>
				<br />
				<br />
				
				You add this room to the list of useless rooms and decide to move on to the next area.

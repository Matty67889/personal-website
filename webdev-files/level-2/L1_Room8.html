			<p>
				You enter the room and immediately realize that it is a kitchen. You were hungry, but you decided not to cook in
				this kitchen, for obvious reasons. Not that there was much to cook with anyway. The kitchen's cooking contents are
				deprived of everything; cutlery, food, even the microwave and has been stolen.
				<br />
				<br />
				
				The kitchen looks normal, with the exception of the floor being covered in bits and pieces of the deteriorating ceiling.
				The cabinets are left open from the invasion of whoever stole everything from this room. You begin to wonder why anyone 
				would leave a house as nice as this. 
				<br />
				<br />
				
				You look around the kitchen for anything that would be useful in your search for the exit, but find nothing. 
				<br />
				<br />
				
				<span id = "thoughts">"Time to go to another room I suppose,"</span> you think to yourself.

				<p id = "r8_added_text_w_note2">
				However, before you leave, you look around the room to see if the note was telling the truth 
				about the crack in the wall. And sure enough, in the far corner of the room, you notice a crack that you had overlooked before.
				Now to decide if you should inspect the crack. You can proababy use the mallet to break through the wall, but what if this is a 
				trap?
				</p>
				
				<p id = "r8_added_text_no_note2">
				However, before you leave, you notice a crack in the wall in the corner of the room. You surmise 
				that you can use your mallet to bust through the wall. Though it might lead you somewhere that will help you with your search for 
				the exit, you remain hesitant about doing it, as it could be a trap...

# Introduction
	This ReadMe was started on December 24th, 2021, with the objective of
	documenting the transformation of this website. The plan is to create
	different versions after a major feature for a version is implemented. A new
	version will be created when this feature is done, and work will continue
	from that version. The descriptions of each version will be listed here for
	reference.

	The documentation for the JavaScript files in the website were made using
	a mix of JavaDocs documentation and Python specifications.


# Style Guide for this Document
	Obey the 80 character rule (don't go over the gray line in Atom for one line
	of text)

	Update the "Date last updated" section when a new entry is added to this
	document

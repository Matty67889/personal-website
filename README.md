## Introduction

This is a personal website project for myself. It will
serve as a portfolio of my work, and give people a place
to learn more about me easily.

As a challenge for myself, I am attempting to create the website
with mostly only CSS. That is, for the main pages,
I will try to not use any Javascript or external packages.
For the projects featured on the site, I am permitting
myself to use as much JavaScript as I want, but I will
try to use as little as possible. The website should
also be accessible, so I will attempt to follow the
guidelines in the [W3C Accessibility Initiative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/).
This was inspired by the prevalence of JavaScript blockers nowadays.

This site is a work in progress and will be updated as time permits.

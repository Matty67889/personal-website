							and work on that story you've had in your drafts for a year.

					<p>
						I am a Freshman at Cornell University studying Computer Science.
						I hope to use my the knowledge that I gain from coding
						technology to develop ways to make education easier
						and more accessible for people around the world. Apart from
						Computer Science, I am interested in learning concepts in
						Psychology. It is an interesting field to me as it helps me
						learn about how are brains work, and I also think that it will
						allow aid me in my goal of making learning easier for people.
						In my free time, I read, write, and play video games.

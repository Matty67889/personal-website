							great</q>. Filled with motivation, you turn on your computer
							and work on that story you've had in your drafts for a year.

							I am a Freshman at Cornell University studying Computer Science.

							Computer Science, I am interested in learning concepts in
							Psychology. It is an interesting field to me as it helps me
							learn about how are brains work, and I also think that it will
							allow aid me in my goal of making learning easier for people.
							In my free time, I read, write, and play video games.

						I am a Freshman at Cornell University studying Computer Science.
						I hope to use my the knowledge that I gain from coding
						technology to develop ways to make education easier
						and more accessible for people around the world. Apart from
						Computer Science, I am interested in learning concepts in
						Psychology. It is an interesting field to me as it helps me
						learn about how are brains work, and I also think that it will
						allow aid me in my goal of making learning easier for people.
						In my free time, I read, write, and play video games.

							My interest in computer science budded when I was young and I
							became enamored by how cool it was to see coding in movies. When
							I first entered high school, my interest was nurtured when I got
							my first taste of coding. I realized that although it was
							difficult at times, it was still rewarding and fun to engage in.
							In college, I am hoping to make my interest blossom by studying
							it as my major.

						<p>
							When I read books, I become enamored by the way authors string
							together words into a glorious symphony of text. They suck me
							into their fantasy world they've created and amaze me with
							unexpected twists and adorable love stories. It amazes me
							that authors manage to create suspense and trepidation like
							that of a movie even in text where everything that happens is
							laid out for the reader to see. Their writing prowess has
							inspired me to try to achieve something as good on paper. I
							tried to write a book when I was younger, and still write
							down my story ideas to this day.

							Throughout our lives we're told that everyone is unique, and that
							concept has always intrigued me. We all think in different ways,
							react differently to stimuli, are interested in different
							activities, and make different decisions based on our past
							experiences. I want to learn more about what goes on in our
							brain, and how our environment causes us to explore different
							paths in our lives. With this knowledge, I will not only
							achieve a greater understanding of our world, but I may also
							be able to use it to find the most effective ways to educate
							people with technology, which is something I hope to do.

						<p>
							Games have always been a big part of my life, whether they be
							digital, table based, or satirical. They challenge my mind by
							presenting me with unfamiliar situations and force me to
							think critically. Oftentimes I am able to apply the thinking
							I use in games to make things easier to understand in real life.
							When I do play games, they usually involve strategy. One
							of my favorites is Dragon Quest 9, an RPG about a hero's quest to
							rid the world of evil. It's outlandish humor and extensive
							vocabulary has taught me a lot, and contributed to making me who
							I am today.

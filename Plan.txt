The Plan

Objectives for this version:
Restore the website's files to their former glory.
- Remake the following files using the README as a guide to what they
  were previously:
    definitiongames.css
    definitiongames.js
    Word.js
    WordBank.js
    wordgames.js
- Add the image for the website back

Ideas:
- Make the Word and WordBank class into one file? (the internet says I can't
  so no for now)
  - Also put the functions from wordgames.js in this file
- Add test files for the Word classes?
